# ScaleConstruction

a Processing.org project for animated visualisations of  musical scales and modes

![Initial Appearance](https://github.com/B-P-THOMAS/ScaleConstruction/blob/master/Snap01.png)

This displays a circular pie chart with the names of the 12 notes of the chromatic scale arranged in clockwise order around the outside.
The initial display has the degrees of the C Major scale indicated by seven small blobs on the circumference of the chart circle. 
As animation progresses, each node in turn is flattened, in this order: 7 3 6 2 5 1 4

At each step it's possible to see that the sequence of intervals still represents a major scale - just the starting note has changed.

This is a visual aid to help with the construction and comprehension of major modes.
